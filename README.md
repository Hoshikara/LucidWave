## DISCLAIMER

#### I advise looking for a download link for LiqidWave if you want a more Vivid Wave-like experience--only use this skin if landscape support is important to you.
#### This skin is no longer in development, check out my new skin: [Nightfall](https://github.com/Hoshikara/unnamed-usc-skin).

Notes:

- Check 'Skin Settings' for various options

- Depending on whether you play portrait or landscape, check background shaders, 'bg_p.fs' is for portrait, 'bg_l.fs' is for landscape, rename either one to 'bg.fs'
    
- Change Appeal Card by choosing one from /textures/gameplay/user_panel/appeal cards and replacing the current one
inside /textures/gameplay/user_panel, make sure to rename to 'appeal_card', .psd template included to create your own

- If you want to use one background for every chart, place all desired background files inside /backgrounds/fallback and make sure 'fallback' is the only folder inside 'backgrounds'

- Custom laser/track colors not supported, check this link for other available colors:
